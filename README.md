# CMS (Content Management System)

## Project Summary

This project is a Content Management System (CMS) developed as a third-year Computer Engineering student. The CMS is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing a platform for users to create, manage, and publish content with ease.

## Technologies

- Java/Spring
- JPA/Hibernate
- MySQL
- HTML/CSS/JS

## Development Process

The development process of the project began with the identification of requirements and the design of a suitable database model. Subsequently, I carried out backend coding using Java and created the user interface with HTML/CSS.

Throughout this process, I gained significant skills in areas such as database modeling, RESTful API design, and SOLID principles. Moreover, this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of complex system architecture and improve my problem-solving skills.
